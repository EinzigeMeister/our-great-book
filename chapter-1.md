Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. No, I'm Santa Claus! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Yeah, lots of people did. __Alright, let's mafia things up a bit.__ *Joey, burn down the ship.* Clamps, burn down the crew.

## Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

Who are you, my warranty?! Say it in Russian! Negative, bossy meat creature! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

1. Large bet on myself in round one.
2. Okay, I like a challenge.
3. Why yes! Thanks for noticing.

### Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Look, last night was a mistake. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

* I just told you! You've killed me!
* Actually, that's still true.
* Why did you bring us here?

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Soon enough. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

Then we'll go with that data file! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. No! The cat shelter's on to me. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. One hundred dollars. Soon enough. You don't know how to do any of those. Can we have Bender Burgers again?

Can we have Bender Burgers again? You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

Take me to your leader! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! And I'm his friend Jesus.

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Who are those horrible orange men? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Belligerent and numerous. Yeah, lots of people did. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Actually, that's still true.

I never loved you. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
